    /// The Common Layer Interface (CLI) is a universal format for the input of geometry data to model fabrication systems based
    /// on layer manufacturing technologies (LMT). It is suitable for systems using layer-wise photo-curing of resin, sintering
    /// or binding of powder, cutting of sheet material, solidification of molten material, and any other systems which build 
    /// models on a layer-by-layer basis. CLI is intended as a simple, efficient and unambiguous format for data input to all
    /// LMT-based systems, based on a "2 1/2D" layer representation.It is independent of vendors or fabrication machines, and
    /// should require only a simple conversion to the vendor-specific internal data structure of the machine.The obligatory parts
    /// of the format are also application independent, while the USERDATA command allows user- or application-specific data to
    /// be defined in the header.This flexibility allows the format to be used for a wide range of applications, without loss of
    /// important information and without excluding data transfer between different applications.One specific application, medical
    /// scan data, is already accommodated with appropriate user data. Others can be added as they are defined.
